# philosophers #10

My tenth project of the 42 school Codam. You'll learn about mutexes and threads and how to use them.

Compile with ```make``` and run the program with some arguments. Example: ```./"program name" "number_of_philosophers" "time_to_die" "time_to_eat" "time_to_sleep" "number_of_times_each_philosopher_needs_to_eat".
The last argument is optional. If you exclude it, the philosophers will continue eating forever.
